# Lamesauce
A Telegram-Bot for adding messages to a webfrontend (see HOS) via old school IRC format. 

Lamesauce currently offers these commands:

- !auth USER - auths a user to push updates to the webfrontend
- !deauth USER - deauths a user, thus stopping him from pushing updates
- !help - lists commands and gives a small explanation
- !bringbeer AMOUNT - brings beer. As lamesauce is quite efficient as a waiter, he can bring up to 4095 beers at once -- but not more.
- !add QUOTE in MoSQL format. Adds to the webfrontend.
